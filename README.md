# Foodity Frontend

This app is for searching for restaurants across a range of cities, allowing people who are passionate about food to discover new restaurants both at home and abroad. A user can make bookings, add to their favourites list or wishlist. There are a wide range of searching capabilities allowing for those undiscovered restaurants to be found and enjoyed. 

<h2>Motivation</h2>
I am passionate about both food and travelling, so this is a great combination of those two interests. When I travel, I love to know the best places to eat in a new city, and creating wishlists for future travel plans feels like a perfect way to prepare for that. Additionally allowing a user to keep track of their favourite restaurants all in one place for mulitple cities is a useful feature. Also allowing users to make bookings ahead of time for their holidays streamlines the process of restaurant searching.

<h2>Server Side</h2>

<h2>Client Side</h2>
The technologies used for the front end JavaScript and React.js on the front end. Material UI and CSS were used for styling.
